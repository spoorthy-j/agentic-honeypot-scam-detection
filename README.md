# 🛡️ Agentic Honeypot Scam Detection System

An AI-assisted cybersecurity system that **detects scam messages**, **autonomously engages scammers using a honeypot**, and **extracts actionable threat intelligence** such as UPI IDs, phone numbers, links, and domains — all presented through a professional web dashboard.

## 📌 Problem Statement
Online scams through SMS, WhatsApp, email, and UPI-based fraud are rapidly increasing.  
Most existing solutions focus only on **detecting scams**, but they do not actively **interact with scammers** to gather intelligence.

This project introduces an **Agentic Honeypot Scam Detection System** that not only detects scams but also **engages scammers safely** to collect valuable threat intelligence.


## 🎯 Objectives
- Detect scam messages using AI-assisted rules
- Assign confidence-based scam scores
- Automatically trigger a honeypot for high-risk messages
- Engage scammers without exposing real users
- Extract and store threat intelligence
- Display insights via a professional dashboard

## 🧠 System Architecture
**Workflow:**
1. User submits a suspicious message
2. Scam Analyzer evaluates the message
3. A scam score is generated
4. If score ≥ threshold → Honeypot is activated

6. Intelligence is extracted and stored
7. Results are shown in the dashboard
